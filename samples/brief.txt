In support of our motion, the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) establishes that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.
The Ninth Circuit reiterated this principle in Smith v. City of Los Angeles, 902 F.3d 1079 (9th Cir. 2018), noting that discriminatory classroom assignments violate equal protection.
Further, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 authorizes suits against state officials who deprive citizens of constitutional rights.
