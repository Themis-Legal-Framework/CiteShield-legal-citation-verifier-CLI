In support of this motion, counsel relies on Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),
which held that segregation in public education is inherently unequal.

Additionally, in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the Court required that suspects be informed
of their rights before custodial interrogation.

Finally, the argument cites a fictitious case, Smith v. Wonderland, 999 U.S. 999 (2050),
which does not exist and should be flagged.
